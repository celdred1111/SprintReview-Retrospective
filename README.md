# SprintReview-Retrospective
SDL-final project


How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
By talking with the users I will develope a good understanding of the user needs. It will be these talks that develop the "user stories". Then the user stories will be given to the developers so that they can build them into the program

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I think the most important ones are be flexible, be communicative and be innovative. I think the agile framework will be massively helpful to that end.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member in software development largely revolves around communication, empathy for your teammates and a good work ethic. Communication under an agile framework is obviously very important. I think empathy is important to understand when you should carry a bit extra weight for the team and when to allow the team to carry a bit more for you. Under a framework with less domineering hierarchical structures, it is important to be self driven and have a good work ethic.
